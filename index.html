          Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its easy-to-read syntax. It's widely used for web development, data analysis, automation, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python's standard library provides numerous tools and utilities for performing a wide range of tasks. It supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.</li>
          <li>It is open-source and has a large community that contributes to its development.</li>
          <li>Python emphasizes readability and simplicity, making it accessible to beginners.</li>

        <p>
          Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. It also includes more complex data types like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python's dynamic typing allows variables to change type as needed. This flexibility makes Python very powerful, although it requires careful handling to avoid type-related errors.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Integers and floats represent numerical data.</li>
          <li>Strings represent sequences of characters.</li>
          <li>Lists and dictionaries are used to store collections of data.</li>

      <header>Control Structures</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Python includes several control structures for managing the flow of a program. These include if-else statements, loops (for and while), and function definitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These control structures allow developers to implement decision-making, repetition, and modularity within their programs, which are essential for complex software development.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If-else statements control the flow based on conditions.</li>
          <li>For and while loops repeat blocks of code.</li>
          <li>Functions encapsulate code for reuse and clarity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that extend its capabilities. Popular libraries include NumPy for numerical computations, pandas for data analysis, and Flask/Django for web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          These libraries and frameworks allow developers to work more efficiently, as they provide pre-built functions and tools that simplify common tasks.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>NumPy and pandas are essential for data science.</li>
          <li>Flask and Django are widely used in web development.</li>
          <li>TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular in machine learning.</li>
